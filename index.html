     <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> known as A. Q. Khan, was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer who is colloquially known as
     the "father of Pakistan's atomic weapons program".[a]
     
     An émigré (Muhajir) from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952, Khan was educated in the metallurgical engineering
     departments of Western European technical universities where he pioneered studies in phase transitions of metallic
     alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges. After learning of India's "Smiling Buddha"
     nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his nation's clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan
     Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was both its chief scientist and director for many years.
     
     In January 2004, Khan was subjected to a debriefing by the Musharraf administration over evidence of nuclear
     proliferation handed to them by the Bush administration of the United States.[6][7] Khan admitted his role in running a
     nuclear proliferation network – only to retract his statements in later years when he leveled accusations at the former
     administration of Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990, and also directed allegations at President Musharraf
     over the controversy in 2008.[8][9][10]     
     Khan was accused of selling nuclear secrets illegally and was put under house arrest in 2004. After years of house
     arrest, Khan successfully filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government of Pakistan at the Islamabad High Court whose
     verdict declared his debriefing unconstitutional and freed him on 6 February 2009.[11][12] The United States reacted
     negatively to the verdict and the Obama administration issued an official statement warning that Khan still remained a
     "serious proliferation risk".[13]
     
     After his death on 10 October 2021, he was given a state funeral at Faisal Mosque before being buried at the H-8
     graveyard in Islamabad.
